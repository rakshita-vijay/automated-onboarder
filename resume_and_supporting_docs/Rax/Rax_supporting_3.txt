Summary  of  the  Research  Paper:   Smart  Home  Automation  System   A  Glimpse  into  the  System  This  paper  presents  an  affordable,  wireless,  IoT-based  home  automation  system  (HAS),  which  
adjusts
 
to
 
environmental
 
conditions.
 
It
 
uses
 
NodeMCU
 
as
 
the
 
main
 
control
 
unit,
 
and
 
allows
 
remote
 
access
 
through
 
smartphones.
 
Seamless
 
access
 
to
 
in-house
 
appliances
 
is
 
provided
 
by
 
a
 
cloud
 
server
 
based
 
communication
 
system.
 
The
 
system
 
aims
 
to
 
improve
 
everyday
 
living
 
conditions
 
for
 
elderly
 
and
 
disabled
 
individuals.
  Key  Learnings  and  Takeaways  Features:  The  system  allows  remote  management  of  electrical  appliances  with  Android  phones,  using  the  
NodeMCU
 
microcontroller
 
and
 
the
 
BLYNK
 
app.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
via
 
voice
 
commands
 
through
 
Google
 
Assistant
 
and
 
IFTTT
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
switch
 
controls.
 
Real-time
 
appliance
 
status
 
is
 
shown
 
on
 
the
 
BLYNK
 
app.
 
NodeMCU
 
connects
 
to
 
a
 
4-channel
 
relay
 
module
 
to
 
control
 
power
 
supplied
 
to
 
the
 
connected
 
devices.
 
It
 
emphasizes
 
smart
 
living
 
and
 
energy
 
savings.
 
The
 
system
 
also
 
enhances
 
safety
 
with
 
secure
 
network
 
protocols
 
(SSL
 
over
 
TCP,
 
SSH)
 
which
 
serve
 
to
 
deter
 
intruders.
 Advantages:   ●  Provides  user-friendly  installation  avoiding  legalities  along  with  strong  and  secure  theft  
prevention
 
protocol,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
150
 
feet
 
in-house
 
range.
 ●  Flexible  integration  which  allows  removal  and  addition  of  appliances  as  required  Limitations:   ●  Currently  works  only  on  Android  ●  Requires  internet  access  for  voice-to-text  on  earlier  versions  of  Android  ●  Vulnerable  to  external  noise;  voice  commands  may  be  misinterpreted  Future  Scope:   ●  Making  the  system  compatible  with  other  operating  softwares  such  as  Windows  and  
iOS.
 ●  Incorporating  passive  infrared  (PIR)  sensors  for  motion  detection  in  the  security  
subsystem.
 ●  Integrating  Digital  Temperature  and  Humidity  (DHT11)  sensors  for  humidity  and  
temperature
 
monitoring
 
which
 
also
 
adjusts
 
fans
 
and
 
air
 
conditioning
 
accordingly.
 
Light
 
Dependent
 
Resistors
 
(LDRs)
 
detect
 
daylight
 
and
 
control
 
lights.
