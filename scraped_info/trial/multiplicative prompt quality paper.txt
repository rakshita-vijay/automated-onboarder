 how  response  quality  varies    ABSTRACT  In  an  automated  agent  world  where  agentic  AI  is  fast  becoming  the  fore-runner  in  the  field  of  
cybernation,
 
an
 
important
 
aspect
 
that
 
must
 
be
 
taken
 
into
 
account
 
is
 
the
 
variability
 
of
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
prompt
 
utilized
 
by
 
the
 
agents,
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
impacts
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
response
 
produced.
 
 This  paper  will  highlight  the  findings  that  came  about  when  the  quality  of  workflow  based  on  
prompt
 
was
 
evaluated.
  Formalized  version:  The  rapid  integration  of  agentic  ai  systems  in  autonomous  (automated?)  workflows  requires

  What  all  to  create  to  test  this?  ●  Prompt  generator  -  simple  enough,  maybe?  ●  Prompt  evaluator  (scale  of  0.00  to  1.00)  -  have  to  give  this  data  to  train  on  
●  Guinea  pig  agentic  ai  workflow  ●  Response  quality  evaluator  (0%  to  100%)  -  have  to  give  this  data  to  train  on  ○  How  to  calculate  performance  decay?  ■  ???     ●  Do  MANUAL  response  quality  check        This  is  the  description
